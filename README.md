Sponsors:
Ceramic: Distributed mutable data storage for the marketplace metadata. Search support.
IPFS / Filecoin: Store associated files, signature, and proof of ownership (ex: deed/title).
NFTPort: NFT issuance for the issued real estate backed NFT (minting).
Unlock protocol: NFT purchase / paywall. Once an NFT is uploaded, unlock protocol regulates access (via payments).

Filecoin

Demo flow:
* Stat/web news about home/housing market
* Create form flow having person upload proof of ownership of home
* Create terms to allow others to deposit to it
* Use react signature canvas to collect the user signature (checking against the deed) and uploading as an image file to the IPFS folder for the property.
* Generate NFT after form completion
- The technology here could be leveraged for other esignature purpsoes as well (beyond real estate), where you want to esign a document and have the signature tied to the document in a filecoin directory.
- This actually serves that purpose but with a self-signed title document.
* API call from chainlink to get house price estimate.
* Login (powered by moralis).
* Search listings (backed by moralis).

Create a limited partnership (LP), issue a token on whatever blockchain you want. Make the bylaws of the LP state that ownership and voting rights for LP is dictated by ownership of said token. Transfer ownership of one or more pieces of real estate to the LP. Whether a single home or bundle. Now you have this LP which owns one or more assets, and you can transfer around ownership of the LP itself by just sending tokens around.
